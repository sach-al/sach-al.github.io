                        <p>Mount Berry, GA | August 2021 - May 2022</p>
                        <p>This was the first job I worked upon attending Berry. I have breif 
                            expereince with event venues, and this position allowed me to sharpen 
                            the skills needed to further that expereince. Typically, I  
                            worked with coworkers to organize external  events via an event management
                            software, and then setting up and overseeing the events soon after. <br><br>
                            Some of the events that I became proficient at overseeing consisted of 
                            weddings, alumni dinners, banquets, and scholarship events. <br><br>

                        <p>Lowell, GA | July 2021 - August 2021</p>
                        <p>I worked for Zachry both as a summer job and as an opportunity to learn 
                            more about industrial business and workflow. Throughout a typical day, I was 
                            constantly learning and then applying concepts to my tasks. Most of the tasks 
                            were ones I was not expereinced with, for I had never worked on a powerplant site 
                            before. <br><br>
                            Some of these included:<br>
                            <p id="duties">Scaffold building<br>
                            Cleaning coal byproducts from tripper conveyer systems<br>
                            Utilizing industrial hoses to clean limestone byproducts<br>
                            <br></p>
                            By the end of the summer, I had succeessfully learned how a powerplant is run, how 
                            to maintain the operations in a clean and safe environment, and what it takes to 
                            manage people in an industrial workforce. <br>
